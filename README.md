Secure Blockchain Compliant Telecom

Abstract

Owing to its' scalability and adaptability, Blockchain is being adopted in many industries. The technology removes the role of "credit ratings" applied by "middle-men" providing for real trust and greater efficiencies to be realized across even the most trivial of transactions.

Blockchain is replacing centralized databases with decentralized peer-to-peer (shared) data authentication, requiring secure computation and networking of verifiable (trusted) nodes.
With its successful application and adoption in various industries including financial technology, the use of Blockchain technology in the telecommunications industry is yet to be adopted. The current telecom industry uses conventional transport methods employing predetermined route selections conducted across fixed (static) infrastructure.

Quanta is stepping up, to build high performance, Blockchain compliant platforms that will evolve the Telecom industry and enable scalable, secure and efficient Blockchain environments

Quanta Networks will inevitably challenge today’s conventional communications architecture by introducing secure, facility free, and tower free telecom based Blockchain ecosystems while bypassing the inefficiencies and lack of security that will continue to exist.

Quanta Networks’ Mission

The Quanta Networks mission is to create the Global Standard for Blockchain compliant (decentralized) telecommunication ecosystems. Quanta’s’ Blockchain Networks will disrupt - and change - the telecom industry, allowing network users the ability to directly connect (peer-2-peer). This provides the fastest, most secure and affordable means of human and machine communication.

The Quanta Vision: “You Are The Network”

Quanta Networks believes everyone should have affordable connectivity with the right to privacy, security and be free to access the information required to conduct their daily lives.
Quanta Networks envisions the connected world as a place where people, all of them connected, contribute and play their own roles to make the world a better, safer and more efficient place for everyone.
It is our vision to revolutionize the telecom industry by creating the first fully decentralized Blockchain compliant communications system that allows users (and systems) to connect to each other directly, more securely and far more efficiently.
Introduction

What is Quanta Networks?

Quanta Networks has an unconventional approach to telecommunications. We are creating a better network, with new networking mechanics, easily integrated into current networking systems. We do not invest in bandwidth but enable devices to form a communication network by themselves using their own available bandwidth. Quanta establishes “facility free” connections providing for faster services, better privacy and higher security.

Quanta Networks QN Utility Token

Quanta Networks QN Utility Token is an ERC20 QN Utility Token which will serve as a cryptographic asset issued on the Ethereum Blockchain. The QN Utility Token implements all the basic features of any other standard ERC20 Utility Tokens, making it compatible with existing wallets and exchanges. Quanta Networks QN Utility Token will serve as a Utility Token, allowing it holders to interact and access the full benefits of the revolutionary Blockchain based Quanta Network. In future, the QN Utility Token will enable users to pay for Quanta Networks telecom services.

Telecom industry Statistics

There are currently almost 5 billion Smartphone users in the world and over 8 billion smartphones in circulation today worldwide that use voice, text and data. The IoT (the “Internet of Things”) employs both mobile and Internet-based communications platforms with 10 Billion devices expected to be online by 2020. With 15 Billion supported network devices by 2020 this makes the Telco industry one of the largest revenue generation consumer industries in the world with annual revenues expected to exceed 1.2 Trillion Euros ($1.5 Trillion USD) in 2019 alone. The telecom industry is the fastest growing industry over the last decade. The industry also must maintain rapid adoption of new technologies to keep pace with the explosion of data usage.

Global Industry Challenges

In today’s era of technology and internet, mobile data access is essential, like gas, and electricity. While 5 billion people are using smartphones, only 1.1 billion have access to internet. A report published by United Nations
Broadband Commission (UNBC) said that there are 3.9 billion people in the world without regular access to the Internet. 90% of the population in the 48 of the poorest countries have no access to the internet.
There are 1.3 billion Global travelers every year roaming the world while using their mobile device for business or vacation purposes. To meet this growing requirement for their customers, Telco operators responded by forming regional and global partnerships employing the existing telecommunication business model.
This existing telecommunication model has a number of challenges to overcome in order to deliver the same “Quality of Service” their customers receive at home, at the same price as when they are travelling. Some of these challenges include but are not limited to the following:

• Roaming rates charged to customers for roaming are artificially high typically blamed on interconnect costs, data carrier fees and access fees paid to the host network operator.

• There are serious challenges guaranteeing connectivity in remote areas typically in tourist zones in emerging and underdeveloped countries where the infrastructure has been engineered based purely on the established local usage economics.

• There is no financial system that can properly adapt to support the telecommunication industry requirement of efficiently servicing a transient customer base.

The Problem – The Issues Quanta addresses

Present day telecommunications companies operate utilizing predetermined route selections in a fixed infrastructure. These predictable paths are susceptible to hacking, malware, packet sniffing, and data capture. In the event of a link failure or disaster these networks do not have self-managing or self-healing programs. The current signaling devices struggle to support large dynamic environments (IoT), have large overhead costs, and have finite address space.

Wi-Fi is the most universally accepted and standardized networking protocol. More than half the world utilizes it to transmit data. 5G technologies uses millimeter waves that travel very short distances and are disrupted by physical barriers such as walls.

Improvements in this new generation of technology are basically focused on just two areas: raw speed and throughput. Raw speed is what new technologies are offering but they don’t advertise that it happens within a finite range. 5G operating systems are exposed to hacking and failure due to the lack of support for dynamic routing or network failover. Security, redundancy and applied network intelligence are not even explored. Corporations consistently work on improving what they feel will “sell” and continue to err on focusing additional efforts on the security of their consumers, leading to significant failure.
The rapid growth of the global economy and its use of the Internet demand a more secure means of communications. Businesses and individual consumers want a reasonably priced service with faster speeds when using their devices. With the recent social network security breaches, users are also much more aware of the risks to their privacy regardless of the provider/application.

The Solution – You Are The Network

Global telecom users are now aware of how compromised most telecom systems are worldwide. The Quanta Network's Dynamic Routing and Permissioned Blockchain architecture enables users to experience unlimited mobility with complete security and privacy. Quanta achieves global security and privacy for personal and commercial transactions.

Quanta Networks security restricts the ability for unwanted callers, messages, emails and location services to intrude upon your privacy, should you choose to remain “invisible”. As a Permissioned Blockchain network with facility free/tower free model, Quanta Networks Blockchain provides a transactional framework for building solutions for the telecom industry. The Quanta Network presents a toolbox for creating new and innovative Blockchain-based telecommunications applications.

Quanta Network requirements involve the authorization/authentication of senders and receivers in all transactions. There are no anonymous or pseudo-anonymous parties due to the identification and authentication process - this makes it impossible for anyone to commit fraud. Validation through Blockchain is just one of the layers maintaining privacy and security.

Self-discovering and self-healing are also a part of the communication and security functions in the Quanta Network. These network routing paths are both dynamically and asymmetrically managed by Quanta controlling inbound and outbound routes. “Cloaked” (or hidden) layers of infrastructure make functional transitory data (i.e. financial transactions) resistant to packet sniffers. In the Quanta network personal node data is impossible to locate due to Quanta rendering all the data invisible.

Key Innovative Features

The Quanta Network is:

Decentralized

Quanta Networks is decentralized meaning the data within the network is not under control of a single entity and cannot be manipulated in one’s favor. All the information and transactions stored in distributed ledgers (or the Blockchain) hosted by individual nodes that possess certified identities provided by the Quanta Blockchain Network.

Dynamic

Quanta's dynamic route selection is determined by latency. Communications are always routed through the fastest secure path across the network. Quanta's ground-breaking model improves the flow of network traffic as it allows data to travel using the fastest available path.

Scalable

The Quanta Network possesses unlimited address space capable of meeting future requirements for IoT, Mobile and Quantum Computing. Quanta Packet Protocol is technology agnostic and can utilize IR, UHF, Bluetooth, WI-FI, Ethernet, 3G/4G/5G cellular, satellite or any other current or future communications standard.

Compatible

The Quanta Network is fully compatible and interoperable with legacy communications technologies (IPv4/IPv6) and is fully programmable, capable of seamlessly integrating with specialized networking applications and all other foreseeable future networking technologies.

Affordable

Quanta Network customers would be willing to pay for more security, they do not have to. The Quanta Blockchain Network solution is designed to work with all existing, as well as future, technology hardware platforms. Quanta also does not require the purchasing of bandwidth as it currently optimizes underutilized bandwidth and pathways existing within the networks it creates. When using Quanta Network technology, the phones themselves become the network.

Secure

Quanta manages network paths both dynamically and asymmetrically. By simultaneously controlling inbound and outbound routes, it creates 'cloaked' layers of communications within the network. This makes functional transitory data (i.e. DNS requests) resistant to packet sniffers, rendering critical assets and data invisible, impossible to locate. There is be no set path for the data to predictably travel through.

SIM/eSim Based

Anyone using a phone equipped with a SIM or eSim will be able to use a Quanta Blockchain Network. This means that Quanta's disruptive technology will be immediately available to be used in the Global marketplace. Having the Quanta Blockchain Network technology residing on the sim/eSim instead of the phones Operating system makes it easier to adapt our technology to the majority of the mobile devices in use in the global network ecosystem.
